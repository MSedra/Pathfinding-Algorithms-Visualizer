# Algorithms Visualizer
Heuristic and Blind algorithms visualizer 

---

## Notes 

* First, choose the starting node "Colored green"
* Then, choose the ending node "Colored blue"
* After that, you can choose any number of nodes to be blocks "Colored red" except the starting and ending nodes
* Press
  * 'A' to run A* algorithm
  * 'T' to run Best First Search
  * 'I' to run BiBfs
  * 'J' to run Dijkstra
  * 'B' to run BFS
  * 'D' to run DFS
* If a path is found, the nodes in the path will be colored yellow showing the exact path/shortest path
* Wait until the current algorithm's visualization is finished
* Then
  * If you want to run another algorithm on the same maze, press the letter of the wanted algorithm
  * press 'R' to reset the maze
